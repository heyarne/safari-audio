# Safari Sounds

This is an investigation of messed up audio handling in safari that I noticed while working on [airsonic-ui](https://github.com/heyarne/airsonic-ui).

## Development

Run the following after installing dependencies via `npm install`:

```
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```

This will start shadow-cljs, watch for changes, and serve everything on `localhost:8080`.
